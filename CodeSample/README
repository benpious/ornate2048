This is a clone of the game 2048 (http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). The goal is to match one piece with those that share its value 
11 times. Every time the piece is matched its value changes, starting at 2 or 4 and increasing by a power of two until it arrives at 2048 ()
The Intention is to clone the game in the style of iOS7's  springboard.
Swipe up, down, right, and to the left to move the pieces.



Known bugs/issues


    Half implemented features: the intention was for the tiles to animate their slide to the next position, for reasons enumerated below,
    this is not happening. They should also have a number on them making them easier to identify, this also isn't happening (the current issue with it is
    that the GLKTextureLoader throws an exception when trying to load them, and there are no texture coordinates to pass into the shaders). I kept in the 
    code that I have presently to implement these features.

    Some of the slide functions in the CSSEngine don't return correct CSSTileMove Objects.
    
    The animations created by CSSEngineController don't *seem* to be correct.

    The tiles should be blurred, the blur function doens't look very good.

    The slide functions in CSSEngine are misnamed, that is, a slide up will actually slide to the right on the screen.
