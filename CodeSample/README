This is a clone of the game 2048 (http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). The goal is to match one piece with those that share its value 
11 times. Every time the piece is matched its value changes, starting at 2 or 4 and increasing by a power of two until it arrives at 2048

The Intention is to clone the game in the style of iOS7's  springboard.

Swipe up, down, right, and to the left to move the pieces.
