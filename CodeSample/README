This is a clone of the game 2048 (http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). The goal is to match one piece with those that share its value 
11 times. Every time the piece is matched its value changes, starting at 2 or 4 and increasing by a power of two until it arrives at 2048

The Intention is to clone the game in the style of iOS7's  springboard.

Swipe up, down, right, and to the left to move the pieces.

Notes for the reader:

The architecture of the app is as follows; CSSMainViewController is in charge of everything -- the app delegate literally just makes one of these and then stops. CSSMainMenuViewController then makes a gameViewController and adds it as a child view controller, and a menuView which it manages directly. 

    Moving into CSSGameViewController, this instantiates and sets up a GameEngine and GameController, and handles swipe events. A Game Engine recieves swipe events and returns the resulting moves, which are then passed to the gameController. The GameController serves a bridge between the engine and the drawing code -- it draws tiles to the view based on the current board and whether there are any animations going on right now. 
    
    GameEngine is where all game logic is stored. Its unit tests are found in the file CodeSampleTests.
